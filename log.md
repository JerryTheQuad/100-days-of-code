# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've managed to download my YouTube video via a Python package called 'pytube'. Kudos to @jezzyubeezy. Also, I started working with the NLTK package and Mathplotlib to visualize the data I receive. I took the Sense and Sensibility book, filtered it (got rid of 'words' like '.', ',' , '!' & got rid of repetitive words) and visualized via Mathplotlib.

**Thoughts** The sense_and_sensibility.py plot needs to have horizontal lines, numbers (to see how many words in Normal vs Filtered text). Need more practice with Mathplotlib. Although, the plot is very simple, I am proud that I managed to analyze and plot the data by only using Python.

### Day 2: December 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I managed to create a simple bar chart by using Matplotlib. Also, I read more on NLTK.

**Thoughts**: More practice with Matplotlib and do exercises tomorrow on NLTK.
